SBA 320H - React Web Application Project
- This project aims to develop a practical web application using React to showcase your problem-solving abilities.

Project Goals:
- Build a functional web application.
- Demonstrate skills in addressing a real-world or fictional need using React.

Requirements:

Technology Stack:
- HTML: Structure the user interface.
- CSS: Style the application's visual elements.
- JavaScript: Handle interactions and basic functionalities.
- React: Manage the user interface and application state.

Project Approach:
- Adopted a step-by-step approach for building the project to ensure a solid foundation and progressive enhancement.
- Utilized React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple, functional user interface.
- Focused initially on successfully implementing a viable GET request using the Random User API to fetch user data.
- Leveraged comprehensive documentation to ensure accurate and efficient API requests.
- Established and verified the functionality of the GET request before proceeding.
- Gradually built up the application by integrating additional features, including:
- Dynamically updating displayed user information.
- Enhancing the user experience with CSS styling.
= Employed an iterative approach for continuous testing and refinement, resulting in a robust and user-friendly application.

Deployment:
- Host the application on a platform like Heroku or Netlify.

Version Control:
- Make frequent commits to a GitHub repository.

Documentation:
- Create a README.md file within the GitHub repository containing:
- Explanations of the technologies used.
- Detailed descriptions of your approach to problem-solving.
- A link to the deployed application.
- Data Integration:
- Utilize AJAX to fetch data from an external source.
- Display retrieved data within the application.

Successfully - ADDED BONUS FEATURE:
Local Storage
- Purpose: Enhances user experience by saving the last searched bird ID in the browser.
- Storage Mechanism: Utilizes the browser's local storage to retain data between sessions.
How It Works:
- When a user searches for a bird by ID, the application saves the ID using localStorage.setItem('lastSearchedId', birdId);.
- Users can quickly retrieve their last searched ID by clicking the "Last Searched ID" button.
- The stored ID automatically populates the search input field for easy access.
Benefits:
- Reduces the need for users to re-enter information.
- Provides a more user-friendly and efficient experience.
